 * waste.h — public API of the WASTE inference engine.
 *
 * The engine is a library first: everything the CLI does is done through
 * the functions below, so the same capabilities are available to any host
 * program (editor plugin, server, app). The CLI in cli/ is a client of
 * this header and gets no private access.
 *
 * Design rules
 *   - C11, no dependencies, no global state: every instance is a
 *     waste_ctx, so a host can hold several models at once.
 *   - The caller owns the RAM budget. waste_cfg.ram_budget_bytes is a hard
 *     ceiling on everything the engine allocates (weights, caches, KV,
 *     scratch). The engine sizes its expert cache to fit and never
 *     exceeds the budget; if the budget is below the floor
 *     (waste_plan_memory's floor_bytes), loading fails with
 *     WASTE_E_RAM_BUDGET instead of swapping the machine to death.
 *   - No hidden I/O: expert streaming happens on the caller's thread or
 *     on the engine's own pool, never via page-fault surprises.
 *   - Errors are returned, never printed. Nothing calls exit().
 *
 * Threading: a waste_ctx is not thread-safe; use one per thread, or
 * serialize calls. Distinct contexts are independent.

 * state, needs the complete model fingerprint before accepting work, and
 * may own a whole projection without owning routing or the forward pass.
 *
 * All structures are size-prefixed. The backend sets struct_size on its
 * vtable; the engine does the same for every view it passes. The vtable
 * object must outlive every waste_ctx opened with it because the engine keeps
 * its address. Version 1 callbacks are synchronous with respect to borrowed
 * pointers: once a callback returns, the engine may reuse an expert record.
 * The caller must serialize calls for one waste_ctx. Callbacks for distinct
 * contexts may run concurrently and must not share mutable state without
 * their own synchronization.

     * The expert cache's reader threads are deliberately left out: they
     * spend their lives blocked in pread, and putting them on the same
     * CPUs as the kernels they feed is contention for nothing.

/* Requires cfg.vision at open; without the tower these return
 * WASTE_E_UNSUPPORTED.
 *
 * An image is not a token. It becomes a run of them: the tower turns a
 * patch grid into one embedding per merged 2x2 patch, and each of those
 * occupies a position in the sequence. So the flow is three steps, in
 * this order:
 *
 *   waste_image_add(ctx, "photo.png", &n);   -- encode, queue, learn n
 *   waste_image_expand(...)                  -- one placeholder -> n slots
 *   waste_generate(...)                      -- consumes the queue
 *
 * The placeholder is whatever the container names as its media token
 * (<|media_pad|> on K3), and the prompt needs exactly one per queued
 * image; expand rewrites each into as many copies as that image needs,
 * in queue order. Skipping expand is not a shortcut — the model would
 * see one image position and the rest of the embeddings would go
 * nowhere.
 *
 * `out` must not alias `tokens`: expand grows the array, so writing over
 * its own input would overwrite tokens it has not read yet.
 *
 * Encoding happens in add, so its cost is paid before generation starts
 * and a bad file is reported as a load error rather than mid-prompt.
 * The queue is consumed by the next eval or generate: a second turn
 * about the same picture needs no re-add, because the first turn's
 * positions are already in the attention state. */
